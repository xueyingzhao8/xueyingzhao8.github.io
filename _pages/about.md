Hi! I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the University of Warwick. My research interests focus on Information Economics, Mechanism Design, and Industrial Organization, examining the interplay of information, beliefs, and incentives in strategic settings.

I am currently on the 2024/25 job market. Here is my [C.V.](../files/cv_xueying_zhao.pdf)

## Job Market Paper

[**"Tailoring Data for Profit"**](../files/tailoring_data_xueying_jmp.pdf)

*I develop a theoretical framework to analyze the optimal sale of information products in the digital economy. A data buyer initially has access to a private information structure that provides partial information about a payoff-relevant state. The buyer's initial information determines their willingness to pay for additional data. A monopolistic data seller, capable of generating information structures that may correlate with the buyer's initial information, seeks to maximize revenue. The key findings demonstrate that the seller can extract the first-best surplus and achieve social efficiency by offering customized supplemental information products tailored to different buyer types. In particular, the seller can implement first-degree price discrimination by strategically leveraging data correlations. Compared to Bergemann, Bonatti, and Smolin (2018), the novelty of my work lies in two key aspects: (i) the type space consists of various information structures, and (ii) correlations are allowed between the data buyer's initial information structure and the additional information offered by the seller.* 

## Working Papers

[**"Contracting with Heterogeneous Beliefs"**](../files/heterogeneous_beliefs_xueying.pdf)

*I analyze the optimal design of incentive contracts in the context of belief heterogeneity between a principal and an agent.*

[**"When to Go Negative in Political Campaigns?"**](../files/go_negative_xueying.pdf) (joint with [Sinem Hidir](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/staff/shidir/)) 

*We explore whether and when it is optimal for a privately informed incumbent politician to engage in negative campaigning by disclosing a scandal about the challenger's corruption to persuade voters.*

## Work in Progress

**"Think Different but Not Too Different"**

*This paper demonstrates that trade driven by differing beliefs is increasingly likely to be mutually detrimental as these differences grow.*
  
**"Signaling in Information Design"**

*I explore the equilibrium design of experiments in settings with two-dimensional uncertainty.*
