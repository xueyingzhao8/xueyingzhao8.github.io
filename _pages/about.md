Hi! I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the University of Warwick, specializing in Information Economics, Mechanism Design, and Industrial Organization. My research investigates the interplay of information, beliefs, and incentives in strategic settings.

## Job Market Paper

[**"Tailoring Data for Profit"**](../files/tailoring_data_xueying_jmp.pdf)

*I develop a theoretical framework to analyze the optimal sale of information products in the digital economy. A data buyer initially has access to a private information structure that provides partial information about a payoff-relevant state. The buyer's initial information determines their willingness to pay for additional data, creating information asymmetry that poses challenges for a monopolist data seller aiming to maximize revenue. My main findings show that the seller can extract the first-best surplus and achieve social efficiency by offering customized supplemental information products tailored to different buyer types. Specifically, the seller can implement first-degree price discrimination by strategically leveraging data correlations. Compared to Bergemann, Bonatti, and Smolin (2018), the novelty of my work lies in two key aspects: (i) the type space consists of various information structures, and (ii) correlations are allowed between the data buyer's initial information structure and the additional information offered by the seller.* 

## Working Papers

[**"Contracting with Heterogeneous Beliefs"**](../files/heterogeneous_beliefs_xueying.pdf)

*I analyze the optimal design of incentive contracts in the context of belief heterogeneity between a principal and an agent.*

[**"When to Go Negative in Political Campaigns?"**](../files/go_negative_xueying.pdf) (joint with [Sinem Hidir](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/staff/shidir/)) 

*We explore whether and when it is optimal for a privately informed incumbent politician to engage in negative campaigning by disclosing a scandal about the challenger's corruption to persuade voters.*

## Work in Progress

**"Think Different but Not Too Different"**

*This paper demonstrates that trade driven by differing beliefs is increasingly likely to be mutually detrimental as these differences grow.*
  
**"Signaling in Information Design"**

*I explore the equilibrium design of experiments in settings with two-dimensional uncertainty.*
