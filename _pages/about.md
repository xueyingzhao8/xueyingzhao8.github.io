Hi! I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the University of Warwick. My research interests are microeconomic theory, information economics, and industrial organization.

I am currently on the 2024/25 job market.

[**"Tailoring Data for Profit"**](../files/tailoring_data_xueying_jmp.pdf)

 *Abstract: A data buyer, uncertain about a payoff-relevant state, has private information---a signal modeled as a finite partition of an expanded state space---that is only partially informative. A data seller, capable of generating arbitrarily correlated signals, aims to maximize revenue by selling an optimal menu of signals. We characterize the properties of this revenue-maximizing mechanism and demonstrate that, despite information asymmetry, first-best outcomes can still be achieved. Specifically, the seller can offer a supplemental signal tailored to each buyer type, priced at the buyer's willingness to pay, ensuring socially efficient full surplus extraction.* 

Working Papers

[**"Contracting with Heterogeneous Beliefs"**](../files/heterogeneous_beliefs_xueying.pdf)

 *We analyze the optimal design of incentive contracts in the context of belief heterogeneity between a principal and an agent.*

**"When to Go Negative in Political Campaigns?"** (joint with [Sinem Hidir](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/staff/shidir/)) 

 *We explore whether and when it is optimal for a privately informed incumbent politician to engage in negative campaigning by disclosing a scandal about the challenger's corruption in order to persuade voters.*
